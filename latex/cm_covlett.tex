Dear Editor:
\vspace{10mm}

We are pleased to submit ``Well-Connected Communities in Real-World Networks" for review by Quantitative Science Studies. In it we examine properties of clusters generated by the Leiden Algorithm and our own Iterative k-core Clustering algorithm. The results are quite interesting.

\vspace{3mm}

The work within represents a collaboration between The University of Illinois and the Insper Instiute in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Tandy Warnow and I contributed equally , and would like to be listed as corresponding authors in the event of publication, but we have listed her last since she was the originator of the idea that drove this study.

\vspace{3mm}

We have listed Vincent Traag as a possible reviewer since much of the work centers around evaluating Leiden clusters. However, in disclosure, we will be sending him a courtesy copy of the manuscript even as we simultaneously make it available on arXiv. 
\vspace{3mm}


We look forward to receiving critique from the review process. We are arranging to have the curated networks we analyzed, made freely available through the Illinois DataBank. This process should be complete in early April. Till then the data 
will be made available by request.

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent
Sincerely
