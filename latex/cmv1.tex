\maketitle
	
\abstract{Community detection in real-world networks is a basic step in scientometrics research, and is typically addressed through the use of
graph clustering methods that partition the vertices of a network into disjoint subsets.
While  the formal definition for ``community" vary across methods, it is well accepted that a community should be well-connected, so that the deletion of a small
number of edges should not disconnect the community.
Here, we evaluate how well-connected the clusters are that are produced using two 
 approaches for graph clustering -- the Leiden software using different resolution parameters
and Iterative k-core clustering (Wedell et al., QSS 2022). 
We find that both methods produce clusters that are poorly connected when applied to real-world networks, but this is especially true for Leiden when run
with small resolution parameter values.
We present a new pipeline for use with these clustering methods that guarantees that the output clusters will be well-connected, and explore its use
on a collection of real world networks, including several citation networks, and their  corresponding synthetic LFR networks.
Used with Leiden and IKC, our study suggests that only a fraction (ranging from x\% to 80\%) of  the  vertices in real world networks are found in 
well-connected communities containing at least 11 vertices.
Interestingly, when applied to the corresponding synthetic LFR networks, a different pattern is observed: most of the network is 
contained in well-connected clusters containing at least 11 vertices.
Since the LFR network generation process by definition assumes that every vertex is in a community, this 
study suggests the possibility that community structure is not globally found within real-world networks, and that clusters produced by
standard methods should be post-processed to evaluate whether they satisfy criteria for being a valid community.
The pipeline we provide is tunable to allow the user to specify the criteria for a valid community in terms of (a)  a lower bound on the community size and (b) the 
minimum edge cut size as a function of the cluster size.

\section{Materials and Methods}
	
\subsection{Methods} 

The custom-implemented ETL process was designed to process a publicly available COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI citations dump and load it into PostgreSQL RDBMS. 
The Citation data (CSV) is downloaded from \url{https://opencitations.net/download#coci} and unzipped. After that, the custom ETL script, written in Bash and SQL, works as follows:
Finds all CSV files and pipes them in parallel using GNU Parallel command-line utility to the load function
The number of parallel jobs was capped at 20 on a 64 CPU core, 128 GB VM to prevent overloading the machine or Postgres server.
%The load function then loads an individual CSV file into a staging view via psql: \\copy stg_open_citations(oci, citing, cited, creation, timespan, journal_sc, author_sc) from '${absolute_file_path}' (FORMAT CSV, HEADER ON)
The staging view is a stub (empty) view that uses a custom INSTEAD OF INSERT trigger to process (transform) a single citation record.
The trigger does the following citation record processing:
Converting creation to the DATE data type
Converting timespan to the INTERVAL data type
Handling duplicate records (by the oci key). There are a few duplicate oci -s in COCI source data. The logic updates an existing citation record with the processed data. Correspondingly, the last processed duplicate "wins."
A SQL script was used to clean the data by eliminating:
Self-citations: from a DOI to the same DOI
Parallel edges: two or more citations from a DOI A to the same DOI B. No instances of parallel edges were found in the dataset processed.
A SQL DDL statement extracts all unique publication DOIs into a separate table and indexes DOIs using a zero-based integer index to facilitate clustering.
The DOIs were checked for case differences. No duplicate DOIs differing in case only were found in the dataset processed.
