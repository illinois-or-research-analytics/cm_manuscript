# CM Workflow

The conectivity modifier (CM)workflow consists of

1. Clustering (Leiden or IKC for now)
2. Filtering out tree clusters
3. Eliminating small clusters
4. Running CM (cm+cm_universal+json2.py)
5. Filtering out tree clusters again
6. Eliminating small clusters again
7. Analyzing the output

2 and 3 are accomplished with analyze_cen.py
5 and 6 are accomplished with analyze_cen3.py
7 is accomplished with analyze_cen.R, which outputs a .csv file
